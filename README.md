🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection using CNN (Transfer Learning)

   This project is a Deep Learning–based web application built to detect rice leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Transfer Learning.
   The model predicts the disease from an uploaded leaf image and displays the result through a Flask web interface.

🚀 Features

Detects multiple rice leaf diseases:
Leaf Blast
Leaf Scald
Brown Spot
Leaf Smut
Leaf Blight

Built using TensorFlow / Keras
Web interface built with Flask

Displays:
