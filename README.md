🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Classification (Full Stack ML Web App)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Deep Learning web application that classifies rice leaf images into different disease categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Users can upload an image of a rice leaf through a web interface, and the system predicts the disease type in real-time.

🎯 Problem Statement

Rice crops are highly vulnerable to leaf diseases such as:
Bacterial Leaf Blight
Brown Spot
Leaf Blast
Healthy
Manual disease identification requires expert knowledge and is time-consuming.
This project automates the detection process using Artificial Intelligence.
